# Changelog

All notable changes to CAU EDR. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project has not
cut a tagged release yet, so everything is under Unreleased.

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Two YARA rules were case-sensitive** where the rest carry `nocase`, so a
  case-folded sample evaded them: the wannacry rule's indicator strings and
  the generic-ransomware rule's extension strings (`.locked`, `.encrypted`,
  `.crypt`; its ransom-note strings were already `nocase`, and the note
  co-requirement keeps false positives down). Both surfaced by the
  detection-robustness harness and closed with `nocase`; the eval gate
  confirms unchanged recall and zero new false positives.
- **ELF parser out-of-bounds read (panic on hostile input).** A relocatable
  object whose `.symtab` declared a sub-minimum `sh_entsize` let the per-entry
  guard pass while the parser read a fixed-size `Elf64_Sym`, panicking on a
  table placed at end-of-file. `parseSymbols` now floors the stride to the
  struct size, exactly as `parseDynamic` already did. Regression test:
  `TestParseELFSymtabTinyEntsize`.
- **Address-range overflow could hide content from the scanner.** PE
  `sectionIndexForRVA` and ELF `vaToOffset` / `segmentIndexForVA` tested
  `addr < base+size`, which wraps when a crafted section/segment range
  overflows; a legitimate RVA/VA in such a range resolved to "not mapped" and
  the imports/strings/entry there were silently skipped. Rewritten as the
  non-wrapping `addr-base < size`.
- **32-bit builds: file-controlled offsets could become negative indices.**
  `rvaToOffset`, `parseDebug` (CodeView) and `gnuHashSymbolCount` now use
  width-safe comparisons and bound the symbol offset, so a high offset is
  rejected rather than indexing a slice negatively on `GOARCH=386`/`arm`.
- Coverage-guided fuzz harness for every untrusted-input entry point
  (`FuzzParseELF`, `FuzzParsePE`, `FuzzAnalyze`, stego `FuzzScan`,
  `FuzzScanHeuristicsData`; `make fuzz`). Each ran millions of mutations with
  no crash after the fixes above; the seed corpora run as unit tests in CI.
- Detection-robustness harness (`scanner/robustness_test.go`): measures the
  benign-transform envelope (case, UTF-16 widening, NUL-infixing, junk
  padding, base64) each string/import detector survives on synthetic
  fixtures, locks in the true positives, and fails if a bundled rule becomes
  brittle. It found the wannacry case-sensitivity gap above. Companion
  harnesses cover the other two content detectors: the structural pass
  (`scanner/static`, a dropper profile stays detected when benign data is
  appended) and the stego pass (`scanner/stego`, an invisible-codepoint dead
  drop stays detected when wrapped in text or re-encoded as UTF-16). The YARA
  harness covers the wannacry, mimikatz, lokibot, generic-ransomware and
  obfuscated-powershell rules (every string-based bundled rule);
  it found both case-sensitivity gaps above.
- Per-file panic isolation in `Engine.ScanFile`: a panic in any detector
  degrades to a per-file error result instead of crashing the whole scan, so
  one hostile file can never drop the rest of a directory batch. Test:
  `TestEngineHostileFileDoesNotBreakBatch`.
- `cau scan --output`, `cau coverage --output` and `cau rules --output` now
  check the file's close error (a `defer fh.Close()` hid a failed flush on a
  written report); `coverage.WriteText` and `FuzzyDB.Add` no longer swallow
  write and TLSH-parse errors.

### Added
- **ATT&CK coverage matrix** (`cau coverage`, `internal/coverage`): derived
  from the shipped content (heuristic categories, the new static and stego
  class catalogs, compiled YARA rule meta), never typed in; text, JSON and
  ATT&CK Navigator layer output; each detector labeled with its Pyramid of
  Pain level; unmapped content listed, never padded. `--expect
  baselines/attack-coverage.txt` gates CI: a lost technique is a regression
  and a gained one must be recorded (`--record`). Four per-technique states:
  detected, partial (acknowledged incomplete), planned (a declared gap:
  T1027.013, T1140, T1564.001) and none (owned by the sensor or console);
  the SARIF rendering flags planned gaps as warnings.
- **YARA rule linter** (`cau rules lint`, `internal/rulelint`): compile
  diagnostics, required meta (description, author, threat_level 1-5, family,
  mitre_attack with a valid id), hex-written-as-text strings (the dead-rule
  class Phase 0 found), strings under four bytes, narrow-only text, trivial
  conditions; `cau` and `generic` profiles, text or JSON, `--strict`.
  `cau rules list` prints the compiled inventory. `make lint-rules` runs in CI.
- **OCSF output** (`--format ocsf`): one Detection Finding (class 2004, OCSF
  1.3.0) per suspicious or malicious file with severity, the leading
  analytic, ATT&CK techniques with names, file evidence and digests, malware
  names and the engine-native detail under `unmapped`.
- `mitre_attack` meta on every bundled rule; `static.Classes()`,
  `stego.Classes()` and `YaraScanner.RuleInfos()` expose the content
  catalogs; `internal/attack` carries technique names (ATT&CK v15).
- **ELF structural pass** (`scanner/static`): own bounds-checked ELF parser
  (32- and 64-bit, both byte orders; executables, shared objects, relocatable
  objects and kernel modules) reading segments, sections, the dynamic table,
  dynamic or `.symtab` symbols, notes, `.modinfo` and the appended module
  signature, overlay, UPX markers and the generic packed profile, and an
  import-set hash for clustering. Labeled anomaly classes for RWX and packed
  segments, stripped or invalid section tables, entry-point placement,
  executable stacks, non-system program interpreters, insecure
  `RPATH`/`RUNPATH`, text relocations, `DT_INIT` outside code,
  LD_PRELOAD-style libc interposers (known interposers named at weight 0),
  loader-only imports, unsigned or `modinfo`-less kernel modules and
  malformed tables. Rendered in text, JSON (`is_elf`, `static.elf`,
  `static.import_hash`; schema 1.3.0) and SARIF (`import_hash`, `interp`,
  `packer` properties); `cau hash` and `cau cluster` accept ELF. Measured: 0
  detections on 4,974 ELF files and 40 kernel modules from a Kali install.
- Heuristics read ELF imports (undefined dynamic symbols, or a kernel
  module's undefined `.symtab`) through the same indicator table, with a
  small Linux set (`ptrace`, `process_vm_readv`/`writev`, `pidfd_getfd` as
  injection) and a **Kernel Rootkit** category (T1014: `kallsyms_lookup_name`,
  kprobe and ftrace registration, `set_memory_rw`, `text_poke`,
  `sys_call_table`). `HeuristicResult.IsELF`; `is_elf` in JSON.
- Smoke corpus: two synthetic ELF fixtures (a clean PIE and a dropper
  profile) written byte-for-byte by `TestWriteELFFixtures`; baseline
  re-recorded with the `static` detector's first true positive.
- Documentation set under `docs/` (installation, CLI reference, detectors,
  output formats, detection content, evaluation, library usage, architecture,
  limitations, contributing); the README is now the landing page.
- **Detection fusion lattice** (`scanner/fusion`): every detector's result is a
  source with evidence labels and ATT&CK / NOVEL ids; the strongest counts in
  full, sources at or above 0.4 of their own threshold corroborate at half
  weight, hash and YARA hits are never downgraded. Rendered in text, JSON
  (`fusion`), SARIF (`fusion/corroborated`) and the exit policy; a `fusion`
  eval detector reports only corroborated-only verdicts. Measured: 0 fused-only
  detections and 0 new false positives on the 349-file Kali Windows tool set.
- **Invisible-codepoint detector** (`scanner/stego`, NOVEL-001/002):
  zero-width characters, bidirectional overrides (Trojan Source), TAG
  characters and data-carrying variation selectors in UTF-8 / UTF-16 text and
  code, presence-based with named context exceptions (BOM, emoji sequences,
  joining and spaceless scripts, right-to-left lines, CJK variation sequences,
  flag sequences). `--no-stego`, `--stego-threshold`; SARIF `stego/<class>`
  rules with byte-offset regions. Measured: 0.10 % false positives on 70,102
  benign text artifacts.
- ATT&CK technique on every heuristic category (`scanner.CategoryTechnique`,
  `scanner.Categories`), rendered in text and JSON.
- **Static structural pass** (`scanner/static`): own bounds-checked PE parser,
  Shannon entropy (whole file and sliding window), TLSH / ssdeep / imphash,
  section / entry-point / header / import / packer / overlay / Authenticode
  anomalies as labeled classes with ATT&CK mapping, fuzzy-hash database
  (`signatures/fuzzy.txt`), import clustering. New commands `cau hash`,
  `cau cluster`, `cau add-fuzzy`; `--no-static`, `--static-threshold`,
  `--fuzzy-db`, `--no-fuzzy`.
- Evaluation harness (`cau eval validate|run|report|diff|gate|policy`,
  `internal/eval`), committed smoke corpus, baseline and regression policy;
  `make eval` in CI.
- JSON (schema 1.2.0) and SARIF 2.1.0 output, `--fail-on` exit-code policy,
  `--jobs` concurrency, resource discovery relative to the install prefix.

### Changed
- Remaining "Astra" naming in the plan, layout and ignore rules renamed to
  CAU, and the GitHub repository is renamed to `s-b-repo/cau` (the old name
  redirects); only the historical origin keeps the Astra name.
- YARA runs in-process through go-yara with a per-scan timeout; rules are
  compiled once; rule meta, namespaces and warnings are kept.
- Heuristics score once per pattern with category caps and a weak-category
  budget; threshold retuned to 7 on the Kali Windows tool set (60 → 28
  detections, credential tools still detected).
- Bundled rules carry `ascii wide`; two rules that could never fire were
  rewritten; the loose ransomware-extension rule requires a ransom-note name.
- Signature database loading validates type, hex and length, rejects
  duplicates and conflicting re-labels; synthetic filler entries removed.

### Removed
- Shelling out to the `yara` binary.
