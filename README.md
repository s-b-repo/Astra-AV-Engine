# CAU EDR — Certs Are Useless

A transparent, open-source malware detection engine in Go. Six detectors read
every file once, every finding is explained with a labeled class and an
ATT&CK technique, every report is machine-readable with CI exit codes, and an
evaluation harness gates every detection change against a measured baseline.

```sh
cau scan --dir ./downloads
cau scan ./dist --format sarif --output cau.sarif --fail-on none    # code scanning
cau scan ./build --format json --fail-on heuristic                   # fail CI on suspicion
```

## What it does

| Detector | Question it answers | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Hash signatures** | is this exact content known? | MALICIOUS with the threat name |
| **YARA** (in-process libyara, per-file timeout) | does it contain patterns a rule describes? | MALICIOUS with rule, namespace, meta and matched strings at their offsets |
| **Heuristics** | does it name suspicious capabilities? | SUSPICIOUS with a capped score, the categories responsible and their ATT&CK techniques |
| **Static structure** (own PE parser, entropy, TLSH / ssdeep / imphash) | is it *built* like something that hides? | SUSPICIOUS with labeled anomaly classes: packer, RWX sections, forged build record, implausible signer, appended payload, similarity to a known sample |
| **Invisible codepoints** | does this text or code carry hidden codepoints? | SUSPICIOUS with every zero-width, bidi-override, TAG or variation-selector codepoint, its line, and the context rules that excused the rest |
| **Fusion** | do several detectors agree, even below their own thresholds? | one fused verdict naming the sources that agreed, their roles and techniques |

Hash and YARA hits are MALICIOUS; scores are SUSPICIOUS and never promoted;
the lattice raises CLEAN to SUSPICIOUS only when independent sources
corroborate each other, and never lowers anything.

## Quick start

```sh
sudo apt install golang-go libyara-dev pkg-config build-essential   # or: brew install go yara pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/s-b-repo/Astra-AV-Engine.git cau && cd cau
make build
./cau scan --file corpus/smoke/malicious/mimikatz_strings.bin --db corpus/smoke/hashes.txt
```

```
 [!] DETECTED (YARA) — corpus/smoke/malicious/mimikatz_strings.bin
     Verdict   : MALICIOUS

     Verdict   : MALICIOUS (fused 1.14 / 1.00, high confidence)

```

`sudo make install` puts the binary in `/usr/local/bin` and the rules and
signatures in `/usr/local/share/cau`, where the binary finds them. Exit codes:
0 clean, 1 findings at the `--fail-on` level, 2 unscannable files, 3 the run
failed, 4 usage.

## Measured, not asserted

| Claim | Where it was measured | Result |
|---|---|---|
| heuristics stay quiet on real tools | 349 files, Kali's Windows tool set | detections 60 → 28 after the rescoring; credential dumpers and injectors still detected |
| static structure does not flag packed benign tools | 49 PE files in the same set | 43 score 0, nothing crosses the threshold, UPX and ASPack named below it |
| invisible-codepoint pass is usable on real text | 70,102 benign text artifacts | 0.10 % false positives, 348 legitimate uses excused by named rules |
| fusion adds no false positives | 349 files | 0 fused-only detections, 0 new false positives |
| nothing regresses silently | `corpus/smoke` on every push | 100 % recall, 0 false positives, gated in CI against the committed baseline |

## Project

This repository is the **engine**: detection content, scanning library,
evaluation harness and, next, an MCP server, under MIT. Fleet state,
response and the resident sensor are inherently stateful and belong to a
separate control plane; the split is by persona, not by withholding features.
The roadmap, the reasoning and the measurements behind each phase are in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

It started as a fork of the Astra AV Engine educational series; the
implementation has since been reworked for correctness and measurability,
and the episode structure survives in the detectors' names.
